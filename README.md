Requisition System - Python Console Application

Overview:

This is a basic Python program that simulates a staff requisition system. 
Staff members can input their personal details, request items, and get 
automatic approval if the total cost is below a certain limit.

Features:

- Collects staff information (name, ID, date).
- Allows users to enter item names and their prices.
- Automatically calculates the total cost of all items.
- Approves requisitions if total cost is below $500.
- Displays a summary including approval reference.

How It Works:

1. The program asks for the date, staff ID, and staff name.
2. It then asks how many items the staff wants to request.
3. For each item, the user enters a name and price.
4. If the total price is below $500, the request is approved.
5. A summary is displayed with all entered information and status.

Running the Program:

Make sure you have Python installed. To run the program:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the Python file.
3. Run the command:
   python filename.py

(Replace "filename.py" with the actual name of your Python file.)

Requirements:
- Python 3.x
