# Requisition System

This is a simple Python-based requisition system for staff to request items and check whether the request is approved based on the total cost.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Staff Info**
   - The program will ask for the staffâ€™s date, ID, and name.

2. **Add Items**
   - You will be asked how many items you want to request.
   - For each item, enter its name and price.

3. **Approval Check**
   - If the total cost is less than $500, the request is **Approved**.
   - If it's $500 or more, the request remains **Pending**.

4. **Get Requisition Summary**
   - View the full summary, including:
     - Date
     - Requisition ID
     - Staff Info
     - Total Cost
     - Status (Approved or Pending)
     - Approval Reference Number
